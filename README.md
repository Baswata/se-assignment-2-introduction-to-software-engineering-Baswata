# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
it is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming
while programming involves creating,updating and testing codes,software engineering involves creation, designing, testing and maintainance of software products
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
requirements; design; implementation;testing; deployment;maintainance.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements-gathering and documenting of users and system requirements; Design- creating high level and detailed design of software product; Implementation- writing code and building the software according to design specifications; Testing- carrying out tests to make sure the software meets quality standards; Deployment- releasing software to users; Maintainancw-providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?waterfall models are sequential with distinict phases, preffered for short term while agile models are iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change, perfect for long term softwares
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Intergrated Development Enviroments- provides tools for writting, debugging and testing code;bVersion Control Systems- important in trackng changesto source code and coordinating work among team members; Testing Framework- library and framework for automating the testing process and ensure software quality
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? modularity in software design is the practise of diving software systems into distinct, self cointained modules, each encapusalating a certain part of system's functionality. it separates concerns and makes it possible for reusability of modules across different parts of the system
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:Unit testing-testing of individusl components in isolation to ensure they work well; intergration testing- involves the testing of interaction between intergrated components; system testing- involves the testing of the complete intergrated system to make sure they meet a specified requirements; acceptance testing- involves the validation of the system's readiness for deployment by ensuring it is up to business requirements.
testing in software development is crucial to make sure that the software product is up to required standards and it works well

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management: Version control systems are tools used to track changesto source code and coordinating work among team members
They include; Git and subversion

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:roles incude; manager, problem solving, negotiator, facilitator. Rensponsibilities are; project planning, team managment, project execution, risk managment, quality managment

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Software maintenance involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment. This ensures that the software continues to meet the needs of the users and its quality is maintained as per required by users.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? privacy and data security; itellectual property and copyright, software quality and reliability
this ethical issues can be mitigated by upholding rights of creators; protecting user privacy and unauthorized access to data,avoiding discrimination.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
